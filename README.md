# Learning GitHub

A [Smith College SDS](https://www.smith.edu/academics/statistics) introduction to GitHub. This `README.md` is a markdown file, so you can use markdown text formatting, just like in R Markdown:

1. Albert Y. Kim
1. P.K. Subban
1. Mario Lemieux
1. Guy Incognito
1. Prof. Kim

Note from Prof. Kim: Later on we'll practice merge conflicts and branching.

Playing with markdown. For examples, see: RStudio -> Menu bar on top -> Help -> Markdown quick reference
